### Hi there ðŸ‘‹
This is my web project! It's basically a proof of concept to get me familiarised with the basics of front-end development. 

The main objective was to test my knowledge in HTML, CSS, SCSS, JavaScript & Git. It's got a couple of libraries like Bootstrap or SweetAlert2, but that's it. 

So it's a fairly unsophisticated website, but thats what improvement is all about! To date, i have improved it by replicating the "e-commerce" aspect in another proyect of mine which uses ReactJS, so be sure to check that out.

This proyect is deployed [here](https://menegol-t.github.io/menegol-t/). 

I organised the JS files based on what page they are called from. So for example, the JS file that calls teh images in the Index dinamically from a JSON file is called fromIndex.js

Demo functionalities:

* It has a VERY rudamentary search bar (try the key-word "madera" and click the button!). You can see all of the keywords in the "contentForPages.js" file. 

* It pulls the images dinamicaly from te /imgs folder (unlike my react proyect that uses cloud storage) via a JSON document so as to make the proyect scallable. 

* It has a basic contact form that will save user data in "novedades.html". The data is saved locally on local storage (unlike my reactJS proyect), but it has all the logic to check if you were already registered in the past, wether you missed a data field etc. To check the logic go to "forNovedades.js"

So, as i've said, you can see the improved [E-Commerce functionality deployed here](https://menegol-t.github.io/Aubier-TomasMenegolReactJS/) and with the code [here](https://github.com/menegol-t/Aubier-TomasMenegolReactJS).

Thank you for checking me out, have a nice day!
